# Mask-Detection
Takes a video or a video capture  of your face and tells you if you are wearing a mask or not. This uses opencv and tensorflow. You can't run this in google colab becuase they dont like cv2 video capture or displaying cv2 mp4 files.
# Training
I would recommend training this detection in google colab because it will save you a lot of time. You can then just load the saved model our local machine.
# Image dataset
The image files are taken from another github repo. Just run the github clone line in the google colab
